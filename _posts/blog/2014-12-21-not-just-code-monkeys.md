Martin Fowler's [presention](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/healthy-social-environment) on building healthy, social environments where software development can thrive is interesting.

Here are some takeaways:

* There are many frustrations about the state of agile today.
* There are many actors but actions are often directed in one way...
* ...a better approach would be to encourage more conversations
* SAFE could stand for: Shitty Agile For Enterprise. (Actually it stands for [Scaled Agile Framework](http://scaledagileframework.com/))
* As developers we need to be knowledgeable about the domain we are building software for. Having domain knowledge allows us to be good user advocates and understand user needs.
* Avoid [dark patterns](http://darkpatterns.org).
* Take responsibility for the software you build and its impact on the world.
