So I recently finished reading [JavaScript Allonge](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge). This is a great book, with recipes for JavaScript that are explained simply yet effectively.

It provides recipes for functions that are clean and straightforward to follow. You can even get a JavaScript library which contains all the functions outlined in the book at allong.es.

I know that this will not be the only time I will be picking up and reading through this book. There are sections I need to go back and read in more depth and play with to fully understand. Using a coffee/barista analogy to tie everything together the book does a great job laying out the basic groundwork at the beginning before delving into more complex scenarios later in the book. Overall, it provides an excellent insight into the elegance of JavaScript and should be on the bookshelf of any serious JavaScript programmer.
