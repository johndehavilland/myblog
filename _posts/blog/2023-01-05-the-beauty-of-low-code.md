We hear a lot about low code but what is it, really? Look the idea you can build software without writing code or less code has been around for a while. If you look at the evolution of computer programming languages from Fortran to Cobol to C, C++ and C#, Java, each step making it easier to build complex applications with a layer of abstraction that allowed developers to focus on the important things. The beauty of low code is that it enables developers to go faster and empowers more people to build things.

Low code is on the rise as there is a shortage of skilled programmers but, and perhaps more important, a dire need for companies to innovate faster. The steam engine took a full 80 years from invention to widespread adoption, electricity took 40 years for the same; information technology took 20 years and Artificial Intelligence — already underway — could take just 10 years. Company age is rapidly decreasing - if you don't innovate, and innovate fast, you will not succeed.

Low code platforms make it easier to build applications and platforms. The real power in low-code platforms is that they make it easier to get a faster MVP out the door, allowing faster iteration on requirements from the customer and ability to evolve and adapt faster. This is super powerful and really gets to the crux of the current wave of transformation.

As we look at low code and we see the amazing leaps in AI driven development with GitHub co-pilot, GPT and ChatGPT being able to generate working code given natural language prompts, one can imagine that the next couple of years we are going to see a huge leap in developer efficiency and those who lean into this will be at the fore front of the next wave of success.
