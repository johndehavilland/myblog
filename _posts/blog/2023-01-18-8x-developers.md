The amazing leaps and bounds in the past few months with generative AI has changed the landscape for how AI will drive faster efficieny. ChatGPT is going to revolutionize development. Here are 8 ways to interact with ChatGPT to super charge your development.

1. **Generate boiler plate code** - ever sat down to start your next project and then had to go do a bunch of searching to figure out the right starting point. I have. Every. Single. Time. Probably because I am not coding everyday anymore but still, its a pain. Well ChatGPT makes this so much more efficient. Not only giving you the starting point but also a recommended structure too.

2. **Explain code**
In a previous blog post I talked about moldable development - the concept of which is driven from the fact that, as developers, 50% or more of our time is spent just trying to figure out what the code actually does. Give ChatGPT some code and ask it to explain it for you. Its amazing.

*prompts: "can you explain what this function does <insert function>"*

3. **Comment code/write documentation**
Ever written a bunch of code, got it to do what you needed then realized you didn't really document it properly. Well, ChatGPT can now do that for you, inline and everything and it never gets lazy.

4. **Optimize functions**
This one is kinda mind blowing. You have some code, it does not perform as fast as you would like. Ask ChatGPT for some guidance. A colleague used this to uncover an elegant performance fix to a challenging problem.

5. **Write unit tests**
No one likes writing unit tests. Not really. Well, some people might perhaps - but for most of us they are a necessary pain. Now ChatGPT can help take the drudgery out of this.

6. **Write code for you**
Look, we have all gone out there and found that snippet on Stack Overflow

7. **Generate regexes**
Need to parse a string input for a something that in plain llanguage is straight forward but getting a computer to do consistently is actually quite hard. Enter regex. But trying to figure out the exact one to cover all your scenarios is more trial and error (or lots of searching). ChatGPT makes this a breeze.

*prompts: "give me a regex for finding all words beginning with f in a string"*

8. **Find bugs**
Function not working and you can't figure out why? Maybe ChatGPT can help?

*prompts: "this c# function throws an error but i am not sure why <insert function>"*

and finally, as a bonus, get it to write comments in the style of a sarcastic cowboy
