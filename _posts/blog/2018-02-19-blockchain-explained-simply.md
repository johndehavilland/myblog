Blockchain technology is all the rage these days. You hear about it everywhere yet what does it actually really do and how can you use it.

Chances are you often hear of blockchain right along side Bitcoin. Do not conflate the two. 

Bitcoin uses Blockchain technology to guarantee correctness.

But there are potentially many other uses for Blockchain.

So what is it exactly?

At it's core, it is multiple copies of the record of transactions that occurred where transactions could be anything from adding money to a bank account through to shipping out a package. This transaction is hashed and that is used to maintain its integrity.

You may hear it referred to as a *distributed ledger*. The key part is it is distributed. Distributed means that x number of people have a copy of it. Everyone who is partaking in this has a copy of this ledger.

Why does this matter.

Well, think about how you do transactions today. You are doing a transaction with someone else and are trusting a third party to be the bearer of trust. In banking this would be the bank. 

Why is this a problem and how does blockchain help? Well, by having to involve a third party in your transactions you incur costs (both monetary and time). Additionally, you have to trust this third party.

With blockchain, the concept of a trusted third party goes away. Everyone, at any given time, has a copy of the state of play. Now, what if someone makes a false entry into the blockchain? Well, since everyone has a copy of the sequence of events then they can flag this as fraudlent. 51% of those participating have to agree - majority wins.

But what if the majority are bad actors? Well, this is where you still need that element of trust. Trust in that the majority of participants in your blockchain are honest and trustworthy.

What use cases can blockchain help with? 
Any scenarion where there is a business network and assets are being traded. Removing the need for a trusted third party could greatly reduce overhead and also introduce greater transparency and validity.

Other use cases are around things like fake news - being able to validate that the news article you see, or the video you watch are the genuine thing.


Supply chain is one area - but one big challenge is getting all vendors on board

The blockchain does not create or eliminate trust. It merely converts trust from one form to another. While we previously had to trust financial institutions to verify transactions, with the blockchain we have to trust the technology itself.

Why did companies rename themselves to blockchain?
