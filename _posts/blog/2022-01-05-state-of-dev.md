Summarizing some recent year-in-review notes from various forums around the State of Development and Developers.

GitHub Octoverse Report - https://octoverse.github.com/
Surveyed around 12k developers


If you make developer's have a faster experience they will enjoy it more
Developer patterns on GitHub reflect that automating software delivery is a key enabler in open source and helps teams go faster at scale. We see large repositories use Actions proportionally more than small or medium-size repositories.Once large repositories start using Actions, teams merge almost 2x more pull requests per day than before (61% increase) and they merge 31% faster. 

developers’ performance at work can increase by up to 87% when reusing others’ code is easy and doesn’t introduce friction.

For example, open source repositories with an average of 30 contributors close their pull requests in a day-or-less while those with an average of 65 contributors take three days or more to close a pull request.
With each additional reviewer, the chance to merge it in a day or less goes down by about 17%

Javascript and Python are top 1 and 2 languages in github. Typescript surprsingingly in 4th place
Repositories that are used for both open source and work are 4.4x more likely to have contribution guidelines When developers know how to contribute to a repository that belongs to a different team or community, it removes ambiguity and friction, and they are 17% more productive.

reating issues is the most common first contribution, and invites non-code contributors. This provides a great way for people to join GitHub and help manage projects. Within first hour, most people create an issue or comment on an issue

Repositories where 21% to 30% of issues are marked as Good First Issues average 13% new contributors. Having more than 40% Good First Issues can help a project attract 21% more new contributors.
