So you may have heard about NFTs in some form or another. You may also have heard of the metaverse. Most likely you have also been scratching your head about what they actually are. Having been in the same boat, I decided to try to breakdown what exactly NFTs are, what this metaverse is all about and why you might care.

First, NFT = Non-Fungible Token. Non-Fungible essentially means unique, one-of-a-kind. The token aspect is a representation of a thing (either physical or digital) that is unique in that you can't swap it for something else and get the same thing. Essentially, NFTs are certificates of ownership. Now, in theory, the valuable part is that, using blockchain technology, only one person can be an owner of one of these tokens.

An area where NFTs are taking off is art, specifically digital art. Staggeringly, a digital artist called Mike Winkleman, aka Beeple, sold an NFT for 5,000 daily drawings he did for $69 million.

You can think of NFTs as the digital version of collectables. This is all well and good, but also fundamentally flawed. 

With a physical painting, you can own the original and no one else can. With digital art, this is not the case.  I can go view all 5000 of Beeple's drawings for free. I can even save them to my computer if I want. So what did someone actually pay $69 million for? Well, essentially they have proof (in the form of the NFT) that they own the original item. In the real world you would pay the money and get an actual painting. Here, since this is digital art, the NFT represents a digital file with one owner. The NFT uses the blockchain to ensure the record of ownership probably cannot be forged (*probably* because blockchain is all about the majority believing something is true). The artist still retains full copyright of their work and could certainly sell more copies.

So, you pay money for a token that says you own the original item of something but that something could be viewed and used by millions of others, just without the official ownership tag. 

This doesn't even cover the fact that, as an NFT owner, you can sell parts of that to others. How can someone own a percentage of a digital image that you just really own a unique pointer to? It feels like the parable of the Emperor's New Clothes a bit here and I can't help but look at NFTs with sceptiscm. In the real world, I can buy a house and live in it, or buy painting and go hang it on my wall and, if it was painted by the original artist, be fully confident no one else has this painting. In the digital world, with NFTs, none of that is guaranteed. There is not a painting equivalent in the digital art world, despite what some people may try to tell you. Those spending significant money are doing it for the comedic value and status and nothing more, don't be fooled into thinking this is something more than that.
