Each year Mary Meeker is a venture capitalist whose work focuses primarily on the internet and technologies. Annually she produces a report of internet trends looking back and looking forward. It is always highly anticipated. Check out the original [here](https://www.bondcap.com/pdf/190611_Internet_Trends_2019.pdf) but here are some of my key takeaways:

* Growth is slowing
    - Internet
    - Ecommerce
    - Ad Revenue
    - Online platforms
        - excpet youtube and instagram
* India and China have a vast, untapped population not online
* Mobile Advertising has surpassed desktop 
* Programmatic ad buying is driving down the price
* Rising cost in user acquistion (33%) - its becoming more expensive to acquire users and it is unsustainable to keep maintaining customer acquisition costs that are higher than lifetime value.
* Mobile usage is starting to exceed TV usage
* Image creation and sharing is huge
* Freemium business models outside of gaming are just getting started (Spotify, Zoom etc)
* 58% Y/Y growth in cloud
* Those doing well use data to determine what customers want
* There is concern about privacy as well as too much device usage
* OnDemand services are growing rapidly (e.g. Doordash, solv, telehealth) with a slight uptick in remote workers
* Rapid growth in online learning - Universities set for disruption
