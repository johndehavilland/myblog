Mary Meeker is a venture capitalist whose work focuses primarily on the internet and new technologies. Each year she produces a report about internet trends - both looking back and looking forward. It is always highly anticipated you can check out this year's [here](https://www.bondcap.com/pdf/190611_Internet_Trends_2019.pdf). Below are some of my key takeaways after reading:

* Rising cost in user acquistion (33%) - its becoming more expensive to acquire users and it is unsustainable to keep maintaining customer acquisition costs that are higher than lifetime value.
* Growth is slowing
    - Internet
    - Ecommerce
    - Ad Revenue
    - Online platforms (especially facebook)
        - except youtube and instagram
* India and China have about half their population not online
* Mobile advertising has surpassed desktop advertising.
* Programmatic ad buying is driving down the price of ads across the board and this trend continues
* Mobile usage is starting to exceed TV usage
* Image creation and sharing is huge and continues to grow.
* Freemium business models outside of gaming are just getting started (Spotify, Zoom etc.) Anticipate innovation and growth in this approach.
* Great Y/Y growth in cloud
* Those doing well are frequently using more and more data to make decisions and drive business.
* From consumers there is a growing concern about privacy as well as too much device usage.
* On demand services are growing rapidly (e.g. Doordash, solv, telehealth).
* There is a slight uptick in remote workers.
* Rapid growth in online learning - Universities and traditional learning is set for disruption.
