So you may have heard about NFTs in some form or another. You may also have heard of the metaverse. Most likely you have also been scratching your head about what they actually are. Having been in the same boat, I decided to try to breakdown what it is all about and why you might care. This is a multipart series, starting with the Metaverse.

Part 1 - The Metaverse

Imagine you are wearing your VR headset and your virtual avatar is walking down a virtual street. Your avatar enters a virtual Banana Republic, tries on some virtual clothes, you like them and you buy them. In real-life, the clothes are packaged and shipped to your houes. Your avatar heads out and into a virtual shoe store and tries on several virtual shoes, with all your real-life measurement information stored with your avatar being available. You buy a pair, this starts the real-life shipping process. Then you head off and fly to a nearby concert venue and enter, presenting your virtual ticket, to see a live, virtual pop concert. You meet up with 2 friends, virtually of couse, one who, in real-life lives in a different country. You chat, you experience the concert together. This could be a metaverse experience.

The simplest way to think about the metaverse is to imagine a digital world (or, really, universe) that is community driven and interoperable (which is a fancy way of saying things work together seamlessly that today may not - e.g. assets existing across games) and at planet scale (i.e. everyone everywhere can connect at anytime and see everything) where both real and virtual work and activities can take place. Even simpler, its an immersive, virtual social space.

The concept of a metaverse first emerged in the novel, Snow Crash (whose author was, until last year, Chief Futurist at Magic Leap). If you read (or watched) Ready Player One, you would have seen a dystopian take on what a metaverse could mean. 

You may be thinking, "isn't this just Second Life?" Second Life was created in 2003 as a virtual world where you can create avatars and interact with others. But it is much more. It has its own economy, patent office and beyond. Many of the elements you want to make up a metaverse. In 2015, it had a GDP of $500 million and its users had cashed out over $60 million. It's an excellent example of a prelude to the future metaverse. 

But why now? Well, a global pandemic forcing most of the world into a state of extended lockdown has caused needs to change dramatically around how we engage. More and more experiences have moved to virtual conference calls. Have you ever shown up to one as an avatar? If so, you are stepping in the realm of a metaverse. In addition, computing power, technology and hardware have all made significant progress to enable a proper metaverse experience.

Other platforms and prototype metaverses exist - Fortnite, Roboblox, Minecraft to name a few. These are all huge and growing in monthly active users. Whether Second Life will make a comeback with this renewed interest remains to be seen. It has struggled to break out of its niche, with social media platforms dominating in the past decade. It is important to remember that Google was not the first search engine. Facebook's Mark Zuckerburg recently talked about [his grand plans](https://www.cnet.com/features/mark-zuckerberg-on-facebook-vr-future-new-sensors-on-quest-pro-fitness-and-a-metaverse-for-work/) for bringing the metaverse to life. What is interesting is that the true metaverse probably won't be owned by one company, in the same way the internet is not owned by a single company. This decentralization will be key to enable the interoperability and sense of ownership. In a idealized metaverse, you could connect your buildings in Minecraft to your creations in Roblox.

You may hear the metaverse being referred to as web 3.0. We have had web 1.0  - where people accessed and read information and we are in the mature stages of web 2.0 where we have social communties and the mobile internet. With the emergence of the metaverse, we are perhaps entering web 3.0. A big difference is how it is powered - the metaverse can only exist with decentralizated platforms to support persistent, live experiences at scale.

What about the technology? Gaming companies are posied to accelerate growth in the metaverse, with Epic Games and their Unreal Engine being at the forefront (check out their [metahuman creator](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/digital-humans)). VR and AR continues to accelerate, from Facebook's Oculus and Microsoft's Hololens. In addition, with the advent of 5g and edge computing enabling low latency, complex experiences in real-time there is a convergence that could enable a metaverse to be created successfully. 

Where all this will go remains to be seen, but you cannot help but feel there is a tipping point here, a virtuous cycle being born, where the metaverse will emerge and one day we will look back and think, how could we ever live without it.

In the next part, I will talk about NFTs and how they are tied to the metaverse.
