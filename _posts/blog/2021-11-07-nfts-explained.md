## Part 2: Of NFTs and Intrinsic Value

Mike Winkleman, a digital artist, sold an NFT of his work for a staggering $69 million through the auction house, Christies in early 2021. It was a staggering amount of money for something that was unclear what it actually gave its buyer - beyond just a digital file that others could just as easily get. So what is this all about?

First, NFT = Non-Fungible Token. **Non-Fungible** means unique, one-of-a-kind. Think of it like this: the Mona Lisa is non-fungible, there is no other Mona Lisa painting. There may be copies but you would not consider those the same as the original. 

Now, the copies may be fungible. One copy could be exactly the same as another copy. If I swapped my copy for your copy, we'd still have the same thing. Now, if I swapped my **original** Mona Lisa for your **copy** of the Mona Lisa, those are very different things and you would have something quite different to what I have.

The token aspect is a representation of a thing (either physical or digital) and contains properties to explain what the item is. Essentially, NFTs are certificates of ownership. To be clear, NFTs are not the item, but a set of properties about the item, stored on a blockchain to establish ownership. Using a blockchain enables ownership to be tracked and stored for all to see. Through the concept of a distributed ledger, a blockchain offers the ability for ownership to be accurate and the history to be immutable. (For more on how a blockchain works, read [my post](https://www.johndehavilland.com/blog/2018/03/16/blockchain-explained-simply.html)). The most commonly used blockchain implementation is Ethereum which is often used for cryptocurrency but also supports the ability for NFTs to be stored on it too.

Alright, so we can create tokens that we can now sell, representing unique (mainly digital) items. Someone can buy this token and they then get ownership of the underlying item. They can, in turn, sell that same token to someone else, transfering ownership rights. This provenance is stored in the blockchain for all to see.

But what do we mean by ownership? This is where it gets a bit weird, especially in relation to digital items, because how can you own a digital item? It's just not the same as a physical painting. If somebody sells you an NFT for a digital file, that does not stop them sending copies of that file to other people. The use of NFTs for copyright has also not been established and therefore, owning an NFT does not mean that you own the copyright. This is important since it means owning an NFT does not necessarily mean you own the rights to reproduce or commercialise what your token represents. It is possible the NFT includes these rights, but in many cases it does not.

So what are you buying? Maybe just bragging rights. At least for now.

Enter the metaverse. If a virtual universe becomes more of a reality, the concept of digital ownership (aka NFTs) gains more importance. This is where it gets interesting. As platforms start exploring the metaverse, the concept of NFTs become more relevant as a way of tracking virtual ownership. Imagine if Twitter started to require NFT ownership validation for your profile picture avatar. As the metaverse expands, you could own your own virtual space within it via an NFT. The character you show up as virtually could be unique based on NFT ownership. 

Look, all of this is evolving fast and a lot of it is currently just speculation and hype. However, at its core the blending of the virtual and physical worlds is really starting to happen. Where it will end up is unclear, but you should be paying attention.
