I am Cloud Solution Architect focusing on advanced analytics and machine learning. I work at Microsoft but the opinions and comments within this blog are my own.

Some projects I created:

[Azure IP Checker](http://azureipcheck.com/) - this is a simple api that surfaces up all the Azure IP address ranges. It is updated weekly.

[Azure In 60 Minutes demo](https://github.com/johndehavilland/azureinanhour) - a set of instructions and code to highlight some cool aspects of the Azure platform to showcase how easy it is to do some powerful things.

[Robot Haiku](http://robothaiku.me/) - this is an application that generates Haiku based on a seed word or phrase. It is created from a trained recurrent neural network.

[Planning Poker](http://www.planningpoker.biz/#/) - A simple site that allows teams to use planning poker and vote on stories.
