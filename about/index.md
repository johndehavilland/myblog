I am Cloud Solution Architect focusing on advanced analytics and machine learning. I work at Microsoft but the opinions and comments within this blog are my own.

Some projects I created:

[Azure In 60 Minutes demo](https://github.com/johndehavilland/azureinanhour) - a set of instructions and code to highlight some cool aspects of the Azure platform to showcase how easy it is to do some powerful things.

[Robot Haiku](http://robothaiku.me/) - this is an application that generates Haiku based on a seed word or phrase. It is created from a trained recurrent neural network.

[Deep Learning Videos](http://www.johndehavilland.com/blog/2018/02/17/getting-started-with-deep-learning.html) - A set of videos on deep learning.
