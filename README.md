# My Blog

This is my simple blog powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with the [So Simple Theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/).

Jekyll is easy to use and allows you to create posts using [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

To start this blog clone this repo and run:

```
bundle

bundle exec jekyll serve
